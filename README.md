## Purpose

A prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So, we create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment. It will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. To group the cryptocurrencies, we decided on a clustering algorithm. Using data visualizations to share our findings with the board.

## Result

I started by cleaning up the data to only have cryptocurrencies that are actively trading, have a defined algorithm, and have a complete set of data. This left me with 532 different cryptocurrrencies. From there I created a three dimisional graph to show how the different cryptocurrencies are grouped together. Each point includes its name as well as the algorithm used to create the currency.

After that, I created a two dimisional graph to show the relationship between total coin supply and total coins mined to show how each currency compares to the rest. Each point includes its currency name.
